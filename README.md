# Tic-Tac-Toe-in-C

This is a simple project (for school) for programming in C that I have built progressively from scratch, which uses only while loops, branching (if-else), functions, and array, with both global and local variables.

It contains a menu, which allows user to choose multiplayer mode, to see their highscore, or to exit. (I plan on adding a Human VS Computer mode in the near future, and being able to let players edit their names in highscores just like in classic games.) Once in game, just play! :D

This is part of fulfilling the module's expectations to write a simple code with loops, functions, data validation, user-exit, and which is well-structured with indentations and at the same time create a project for myself that is fun :D
