# Tic-Tac-Toe-in-C

This is a simple project (for school) for programming in C that I have built progressively from scratch, which uses only while loops, if-else, functions, and array, with both global and local variables.

It contains a menu, which allows user to choose multiplayer mode, to see their highscore, or to exit. (I plan on adding a Human VS Computer mode in the near future, and being able to let players edit their names in highscores just like in classic games.)

This is part of fulfilling the module's expectations to write a code which has loops, functions, data validation, user-exit, and which is well-structured with indentations.
